# Star Trek Content Status

Master progress index for the Star Trek universe repository.

## Status legend

- ⬜ `TODO` — not started.
- 🟨 `IN_PROGRESS` — active research or structuring.
- 🟧 `NEEDS_REVIEW` — substantially researched, pending consistency/provenance review.
- 🟦 `NEEDS_ROBERTO` — requires a creative/game-design decision that cannot be resolved from sources alone.
- ✅ `COMPLETE` — researched to the current defined scope, structured, provenance recorded, validated, translated into game-usable design/data where applicable, with no known blocking gaps.

A folder not explicitly listed here inherits `TODO`. `COMPLETE` is not permanent: new evidence or a detected contradiction can reopen a block.

## Current command priority

1. ✅ Documentary foundation
2. ✅ Chronology and era model
3. ✅ Starfleet institutional baseline
4. ✅ Starfleet Academy
5. ✅ Career bridge: Academy → first assignment → service record
6. 🟨 Starfleet technology and starships
7. ⬜ Species, factions, astrography and wider universe
8. ⬜ Narrative, AI, presentation and runtime content derived from validated lore
